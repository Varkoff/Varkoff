### Hello there 👋

I'm  *Varkoff*. From France 🇫🇷.

Favorite drink while coding : green tea 🍵

I am fascinated by performance, optimization and fast websites.

Currently learning and mastering ⚛️ React.js and 💿 Remix.


Here are some projects I've worked on :

[Vinylmania](https://vinylmania.fr) is a platform where vinyle collectors give, trade and buy vinyles from other collectors.
