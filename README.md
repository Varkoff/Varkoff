### Bonjour 👋

I'm  *Virgile*. From France 🇫🇷.

Favorite drink while coding : green tea 🍵

I am fascinated by performance, optimization and fast websites.

Currently learning and mastering ⚛️ React.js and 💿 Remix.

Here are some projects I've worked on :

I am currently working on [Algomax](https://algomax.fr) and building awesome mobile apps.

I just started making a french Youtube channel. If you understand french and are interested in React and Typescript, [consider subscribing](https://www.youtube.com/@Varkoff/videos) for great content !

[Vinylmania](https://vinylmania.fr) is a platform where vinyle collectors give, trade and buy vinyles from other collectors.
